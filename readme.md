## Genetic Algorithm Example in Ruby
Drawing a picture with a genetic algorithm.

### How to run
Replace the image [original_image.png](original_image.png) in the code with your own image if you like. Small size is of course faster (e.g. 256x256)

```
bundle install
ruby main.rb
```
The output will be in the root folder every 10th generation.
